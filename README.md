## Prerequisites

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for package management. Install pnpm globally if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

or

```bash
pnpm start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

**Note**: PWA features (service worker, install prompt) are only available in production builds.

## Available Scripts

- `pnpm start` - Start development server
- `pnpm run build` - Build for production
- `pnpm run test` - Run unit tests
- `pnpm run lint` - Run linting
- `pnpm run format:fix` - Fix formatting and linting issues

## Building for Production

To build the project with PWA features enabled:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. The production build includes:

- Service worker registration
- Optimized assets and caching
- PWA manifest file
- Offline capabilities

## Testing PWA Features

To test PWA features locally:

1. Build the production version:

   ```bash
   ng build
   ```

2. Serve the built files using a local server:

   ```bash
   npx http-server dist/room-planner/browser -p 8080
   ```

3. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser
4. Test installation, offline functionality, and service worker features

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
