# RoomPlanner

RoomPlanner is an Angular-based tool for planning room layouts and experimenting with furniture arrangements.
This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.11.

## Installation

Install the dependencies before building or serving the project.

```bash
npm install
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Linting

Run ESLint to check for style issues:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```
For environments without a browser, use:

```bash
npm run test:ci
```

The `test:ci` script attempts to locate Chrome or Chromium automatically. If it
fails, set the `CHROME_BIN` environment variable to the full path of your
browser executable.


## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
